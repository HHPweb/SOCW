	<h5>Graduate Association of Social Workers (GASW)</h5>
	
	<p>The Graduate Association of Social Workers (GASW) was developed for graduate social work students to have a collective voice for student concerns, serve the community, organize educational, cultural, and political opportunities, support student initiatives of all forms, and foster a positive relationship between students, faculty, staff and the community. GASW provides students with an opportunity to network with their fellow students outside of the classroom and to come together to meet common goals.

Membership requirements include dues of $20 and 10 hours of documented volunteer service during the academic year. GASW has a commitment to provide ongoing service to the Intergenerational Community Center of West Greenville. However, any and all service to the community counts towards membership.

	<h5>PHI ALPHA HONOR SOCIETY - (CHI ZETA CHAPTER)</h5>
	
	<p>Phi Alpha fosters high standards of education for social work students and invites into membership those who have demonstrated excellence in scholarship and leadership in social work. Phi Alpha&apos;s slogan &quot;Through Knowledge-the Challenge to Serve,&quot;embraces the overall purpose of the organization.</p>
	
	<p>The concept of a National Social Work Honor Society came from a group of undergraduates at Michigan State University. Although local chapters were found to exist at different schools, there was no national organization. These schools indicated a desire to form a national organization and thus in November, 1960, a National Honor Society Committee was formed. For the next two years the committee worked on the constitution and other administrative problems. Upon approval of the constitution by six chapters in 1962, the society was formed. Over 110 chapters are now in existence, and the addition of new chapters is continuing among Schools of Social Work.</p>
	
	<p>Membership in this organization is the highest honor that a student can receive in Social Work at East Carolina University. Students in the ECU School of Social Work who have completed at least 9credit hours of course work in a social work program, possess a minimum GPA of 3.5 in their major and an overall GPA of 3.0, and have a desire to serve others and promote the profession of Social Work are strongly encouraged to apply. For more information on the CHI ZETA chapter contact Dr. Tracy Carpenter-Aeby, <a href="mailto:carpenteraebyt@ecu.edu">carpenteraebyt@ecu.edu</a>, or to learn more about Phi Alpha Honor Society visit the national website, <a href="http://www.phialpha.org/">www.phialpha.org</a></p>
