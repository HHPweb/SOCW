I am proud to say that my graduate education has endowed me with an amount of maturity, self knowledge and compassion that will be the driving factor toward any success I may enjoy.  I will be always grateful to ECU, its faculty, and my fellow classmates for helping me build an enduring foundation in which all my future education and professional experiences will be deeply rooted.&quot;</p>

I use many of the teachings I learned during my BSW and MSW studies in the field today. The professors were wonderful and always available to answer any questions you may have had or offer any suggestions to a particular assignment I may have had some confusion about. The coursework was very challenging and required me to really push myself at times."</p>
