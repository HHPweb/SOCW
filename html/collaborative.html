	<p>The North Carolina Child Welfare Education Collaborative (NC-CWEC) is a unique, statewide partnership focused on improving <a href="http://ssw.unc.edu/cwec/nccw.htm"> child welfare services in North Carolina</a>. Established in 1999, the Collaborative is administered by the <a href="http://ssw.unc.edu/jif/">Jordan Institute for Families</a> and is a joint effort of the <a href="http://www.ncdhhs.gov/dss/">NC Division of Social Services</a>, the <a href="http://www.ncacdss.org/">North Carolina Association of County Directors of Social Services</a>, the North Carolina Chapter of the <a href="http://www.naswnc.org/">National Association of Social Workers</a>. As it aims to counter high attrition rates, the Collaborative promotes excellence and leadership in child welfare through education, research and curriculum development.</p>
	
	<p>Emphasizing public child welfare practice, the Collaborative provides educational opportunities and financial support to social work students who commit to employment in a North Carolina county department of social service. The specific amount of financial support offered is based on the student's degree program, part-time or full-time status, and several other factors.</p>
