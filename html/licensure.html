	<h3 class="contentHeading">School Social Work Licensure</h3>
	
	<p>Social work services in schools were first practiced to meet specific problems such as helping immigrant children and their families adapt to school settings. Gradually its use spread from urban to rural settings. Today, the complexity of society necessitates that almost all children and families at some point, require the assistance of skilled social workers to deal with problems and to negotiate bureaucratic systems. School social workers are licensed in North Carolina by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. East Carolina University's School of Social Work and College of Education have been authorized to train and recommend students for licensure.
