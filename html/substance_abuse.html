	<h5>Program Description</h5>
	
	<p>The substance abuse certificate program is designed to provide graduate social work students with the necessary core functions and competencies of substance abuse counseling.  This body of knowledge will allow the student who obtains the certification an opportunity to earn their Licensed Clinical Addictions Specialist (LCAS) credential from the North Carolina Substance Abuse Professional Practice Board (NCSAPPB).  Individuals who are licensed may engage in clinical practice with substance abusing clients. The courses will be taught both on site at ECU and on-line by credentialed social work faculty. The certificate classes will be offered as electives in the graduate social work curricula.</p>
	
	<p>NCSAPPB certifies the Licensed Clinical Addictions Specialist (LCAS).  Students who receive the certificate qualify under NCSAPPB Criteria “C” for LCAS Certification.  After completion of the certificate program, students will be required to meet the additional requirements of Criteria “C” in order to become licensed. This certificate will not waive other NCSAPPB requirements. For more information on the Substance Abuse Certificate please email us at <a href="mailto:SWSAC@ecu.edu"> SWSAC@ecu.edu</a>.</p>
