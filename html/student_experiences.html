	<h3 class="contentHeading">Student Experiences in Social Work</h3>
	
	<p>One of our goals for social work students is to not only gain the education they need to be a successful professional, but also the practical experiences that give them an edge in the professional world. The student experience encompasses not only your time in the classroom, but also your time in the field. The listings below are only a few of the things students may experience while enrolled in programs within the School of Social Work. Please contact us if you have specific questions concerning the program(s) that are of interest to you.</p>
	
	<h5>Student Organizations</h5>
	
	<p>We encourage students to participate in one of the various student organizations within the School of Social Work. These organizations provide students opportunities for networking with other students, participating in community outreach projects, and to attend conferences. Currently, the school is affiliated with the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), Baccalaureate Social Work Student Association (BSWSA), Graduate Association of Social Workers (GASW), and PHI ALPHA HONOR SOCIETY - (CHI ZETA CHAPTER).

	<h5>Field Internship/Placement</h5>
	
	<p>Undergraduate and Graduate students are required to do professional internships or field placements as part of their degree programs. These field placements give the student an opportunity to learn and gain experience through &quot;hands-on&quot; instruction. Students are placed in an approved agency and work there throughout the semester for a certain number of (predetermined) hours, depending upon what program they are in. These placements are a great way for individuals to experience different types of career settings while still pursuing their degree. Field internships/placements many lead to future employment after graduation.</p>
	
	<h5>Skills Lab</h5>
	
	<p>The Social Work skills lab is utilized for instruction and practice of certain skills social workers need to be effective. The lab has video equipment for taping and reviewing certain activities that students participate in. It is also utilized for group seminars and discussions pertaining to the practice of social work. The skills lab is located in the Rivers building room 230.</p>
